# Learning C++
## Udemy
Solutions to the challenges completing the various sections of the Cpp course on the udemy platform https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/<br> The numbering starts with 13, as I have formatted my computer in the meantime and lost the solutions of the earlier sections. The folders contain subfolder with files and a description of the challenge provided by the course, subfolder with my solution and sometimes in addition a README file with a description made by me.
## Sololearn
Some solutions to tasks from the Sololearn phone app that I solved for convenience on the computer.
